Fringe Search Visualization
=========================

A visualizator for the fringe search algorithm.

IO link:
http://huvaakoodia.github.io/FringeSearchVisualization/

The algorithm is based on this research paper:
http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/pathfind/publications/cig2005.pdf

The canvas code is based on this tutorial:
http://simonsarris.com/blog/510-making-html5-canvas-useful


Created only for the visualization purposes.
As such the code isn't cleaned up and my version of the algorithm certainly isn't optimized (and it's javascript!).

Feel free to fork the repo and do with it what you please.
